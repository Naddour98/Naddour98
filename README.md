# Hello 👋

## This is a summary who I am in the world of data 🤓


### Where I was

🐈 I stumbled upon data analysis in late 2023 when I was writing a paper for a course in my finance master's degree. I didn't know I was applying data analysis practices back then but I realized that I enjoyed inferring things from data and answering questions more than I enjoy working with financial data.

🐈 I really delved deep into it when I wrote my thesis in mid 2024 and had to deal with almost every single symptom of bad data there was. The data was so bad, I couldn't even get a conclusive result from the analysis.

### Where I am

🐈 I official began my data analysis career in Dec. 2024 and that's when all the things I did during my master's degree started to fit in place.

🐈 I finished the Google Data Analytics and Google Advanced Data Analytics certificates on coursera

🐈 I finished my first project in machine learning using gridsearchCV and XG Boost

### Where I want to be

🐈 I want to finish more projects using AI and machine learning.

🐈 I want to take more courses which teach me new things.

🐈 I want to participate in data competitions to hone my skills.
